# Action Recognition with Deep Learning

This branch hosts the code for the technical report ["Towards Good Practices for Very Deep Two-stream ConvNets"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02159), and more.

### Updates
- Sep. 30, 2015
  * Support for [cuDNN v3](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn). 
- Sep. 7, 2015
  * New mechanism for parallel comminucation reduced parallel overhead.
  * Batch normalization, courtesy of [@Cysu](https://github.com/Cysu).

### Features
- `VideoDataLayer` for inputing video data.
- Training on optical flow data. 
- Data augmentation with fixed corner cropping and multi-scale cropping.
- Parallel training with multiple GPUs.
- cuDNNv3 integration.

### Usage
Generally it's the same as the original caffe. Please see the original README. 
Please see following instruction for accessing features above. More detailed documentation is on the way.

- Video/optic flow data
  - First use the [optical flow extraction tool](https://github.com/wanglimin/dense_flow) to convert videos to RGB images and opitcal flow images.
  - A new data layer called `VideoDataLayer` has been added to support multi-frame input. See the UCF101 sample for how to use it.
  - **Note:** The `VideoDataLayer` can only input the optical-flow images generated by the tool listed above.
- Fixed corner cropping augmentation
  - Set `fix_crop` to `true` in `tranform_param` of network's protocol buffer definition.
- "Multi-scale" cropping augmentation
  - Set `multi_scale` to `true` in `transform_param`
  - In `transform_param`, specify `scale_ratios` as a list of floats smaller than one, default is `[1, .875, .75, .65]`
  - In `transform_param`, specify `max_distort` to an integer, which will limit the aspect ratio distortion, default to `1`
- cuDNN v3
 - Current default config for cuDNNv3 yields a reasonable speed up over cuDNNv2. You can get this by simply replacing the library files.
 - If you have plenty of GPU memory, there is parameter `richness` in the solver protobuf. Setting it to a number higher than `1`, e.g. `10` or `20`, will potentially further accelerate the computation, but this will cost a significant amount of GPU memory.
- Training with multiple GPUs
  - Requires OpenMPI > 1.7.4 ([Why?](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=runcuda)). **Remember to compile your OpenMPI with option `--with-cuda`**
  - Specify list of GPU IDs to be used for training, in the solver protocol buffer definition, like `device_id: [0,1,2,3]`
  - Compile using cmake and use `mpirun` to launch caffe executable, like 
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DUSE_MPI=ON
make && make install
mpirun -np 4 ./install/bin/caffe train --solver=<Your Solver File> [--weights=<Pretrained caffemodel>]
```
**Note**: actual batch_size will be `num_device` times `batch_size` specified in network's prototxt.

  - [Technical Report](http://wanglimin.github.io/papers/WangGHQ15.pdf)

### Extension
Currently all existing data layers sub-classed from `BasePrefetchingDataLayer` support parallel training. If you have newly added layer which is also sub-classed from `BasePrefetchingDataLayer`, simply implement the virtual method 
```C++
inline virtual void advance_cursor();
```
Its function should be forwarding the "data cursor" in your data layer for one step. Then your new layer will be able to provide support for parallel training.

# Caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.
